ðŸŽ® Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Java: A Fun Project to Showcase Problem-Solving Skills ðŸš€

Iâ€™ve recently worked on a Tic-Tac-Toe game using Java which combines a range of core programming concepts to create an interactive game. This project helped me strengthen my skills in:

ðŸ”¹ OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
ðŸ”¹ Classes & Inheritance
ðŸ”¹ AI (Artificial Intelligence) Integration
ðŸ”¹ Randomization for AI Moves
ðŸ”¹ User Input Validation
ðŸ”¹ Error Handling
ðŸ”¹ Game Logic Implementation

The game features a Human Player vs AI, where I implemented AI algorithms for making random moves, and input validation to ensure a smooth gameplay experience.

Key concepts covered in this project:

Board Representation: Using a 2D array to store the game state.
Game Logic: Checking for wins, draws, and valid moves.
AI Strategy: Implementing basic AI to play against the human player.
ðŸ”¹ This hands-on project not only improved my Java skills but also gave me valuable experience in problem-solving, game development, and AI integration.
